<br>The player attempts to shoot moving rockets. The game displays the how-to-play instructions.

The game is written in x86 assembly language and tested on Dos box and emu8086.

Since it was a side project, I wrote an Arabic commented version:
<br>`MainArabicCommented.asm;`

### How to use?
* Clone this repository.
* Make sure to install DOS box.
* Assemble Main.asm files from the DOS box using
<br>`masm main.asm;`
* Run the ouput `.exe` file and enjoy.
